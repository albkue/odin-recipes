"The Odin Project - Recipes
This is the first project I've created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. I spent about a week reading through all the articles, and I'm excited to apply what I've learned.

I hope to gain a better understanding of fundamental HTML, including:

Structuring a web page using boilerplate code.

Using various HTML tags to format and present information clearly.

How to link between pages and include images.

This project is a great way to put the foundational lessons into practice and build my skills as a developer!"
