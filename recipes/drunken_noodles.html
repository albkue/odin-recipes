    <h2><B>Description</B></h2>
    <p>
        Drunken noodles, or Pad Kee Mao, are a popular and delicious Thai stir-fry dish.
        Despite the name, they do not contain alcohol. 
        The dish features broad rice noodles stir-fried with a savory, spicy sauce, and a mix of vegetables and protein. 
        The key to its unique flavor is the combination of Thai basil, chili, and a dark soy sauce blend

    <h2><b>Directions</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Soak rice noodles in hot water until flexible, 10 to 15 minutes. 
            Occasionally move the noodles around to separate them. 
            Drain the water and cover with a wet paper towel.
        </li>
        <li>Combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, Asian fish sauce, maple syrup, sugar, and water in a small bowl</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok, or large frying pan, 
            over medium-high heat. Stir-fry shallots, chile peppers, and garlic until shallots are soft, about 2 minutes. 
            Move the mixture around the outside of the pan to create a space and add chicken. Sear for 1 minute, then combine with shallot mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Add Chinese broccoli stems and stir-fry until tender, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Chinese broccoli leaves and stir-fry until wilted.</li>
        <li>Add drunken noodle sauce and sliced scallions; mix well and cook until sauce begins to simmer.</li>
        <li>Add soaked rice noodles and toss to coat until noodles have absorbed the sauce and are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in Thai basil leaves until wilted. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Serve.</li>
